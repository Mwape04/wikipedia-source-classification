1. Business Understanding

Problem Statement
Wikipedia relies heavily on high-quality, credible sources to maintain its status as a trusted information platform. Currently, finding and verifying suitable web pages is manual and time-consuming, leading to inconsistent citation quality. An automated system that can classify web pages by resource type (e.g., academic journal, news article, blog, government report) can help editors quickly identify appropriate sources, improving efficiency and reliability.

2. Business Objectives
Success means enabling Wikipedia editors and curators to automatically detect and categorize potential sources from millions of web pages.

Reduce time spent manually reviewing sources.

Improve the credibility and quality of citations.

Provide consistent classification across all articles.

3. Data Mining Goals
We will build a classification model to assign a resource type label (e.g., "academic source", "news", "blog", "government document") to a given web page.
The model will:

i)Analyze page text, metadata, and structure.

ii)Predict the correct resource category.

iii)Rank or filter sources for Wikipedia editors.

4. Initial Project Success Criteria

i)Achieve at least 85% classification accuracy on a labeled test dataset.

ii)Classify each page in under 3 seconds.

iii)Produce categories that are distinct, interpretable, and easy for humans to verify.

iv)Generalize well to new, unseen sources.
