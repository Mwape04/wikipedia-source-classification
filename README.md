1. Business Understanding  

Problem Statement 

Wikipedia relies heavily on high-quality, credible sources to maintain its status as a trusted information platform. Currently, finding and verifying suitable web pages is manual and time-consuming, leading to inconsistent citation quality. An automated system that can classify web pages by resource type (e.g., academic journal, news article, blog, government report) can help editors quickly identify appropriate sources, improving efficiency and reliability.  

2. Business Objectives  
Success means enabling Wikipedia editors and curators to automatically detect and categorize potential sources from millions of web pages.  

- Reduce time spent manually reviewing sources.  
- Improve the credibility and quality of citations.  
- Provide consistent classification across all articles.  
- Ensure fairness and transparency by clearly documenting why a source is classified under a certain type.  
- Enhance community trust by ensuring only reliable and verifiable sources are suggested.  
- Reduce bias in source recommendations by accounting for diverse perspectives and regions.  
- Scale the solution to handle multilingual sources in future iterations.
- Minimize false positives (misclassifying unreliable sources as credible).

3. Data Mining Goals  
We will build a classification model to assign a resource type label (e.g., "academic source", "news", "blog", "government document") to a given web page.  
The model will:  

i) Analyze page text, metadata, and structure.  
ii) Predict the correct resource category.  
iii) Rank or filter sources for Wikipedia editors.  
iv) Build in a confidence score for each classification so editors know when to double-check.  
v) Identify and flag sources with low credibility or potential bias.
vi) Adapt to evolving source types (e.g., emerging media formats) via periodic model retraining.
vii) Support incremental learning to incorporate editor feedback over time.

4. Initial Project Success Criteria  

i) Achieve at least 85% classification accuracy on a labeled test dataset.  
ii) Classify each page in under 3 seconds.  
iii) Produce categories that are distinct, interpretable, and easy for humans to verify.  
iv) Generalize well to new, unseen sources.  
v) Successful integration with a prototype plugin/tool for editors within the project timeline.  
vi) Achieve >90% precision for high-stakes categories (e.g., academic/government sources).
vii) Maintain false-positive rates below 5% for unreliable source types. 
viii) Demonstrate scalability by processing 10,000+ pages/hour in a test environment.  

This initiative will ultimately streamline the citation workflow for Wikipedia editors by providing a scalable and intelligent approach to source classification. By leveraging data mining techniques, we aim to enhance both efficiency and reliability across the entire citation lifecycle.
